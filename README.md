Pre-requisites:
1) should  have pygame
2) should have colorsys
3) math library should be inbuilt. if not hit the install button

During compilation, ideally you should get no errors. If errors do show, feel free to check it out on https://stackoverflow.com

After running the code, a donut spinning should appear. It changes its colors too.

Feel free to mess with the speed, rotation etc to get the best out of this project.
